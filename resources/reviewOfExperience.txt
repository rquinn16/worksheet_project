I would want to improve our controller implementation. Our controller class was itself the controller, and I realize now that there is no way for the receivers of our code to know what the controllers are supposed to do. We should have instead used a features interface to explicitly state what the controller will change in the model based on the view. This is the biggest lesson we learned from our receivers' communications with us, and we did end up making this fix for them. Even though we noticed numerous flaws in our providers code, they were extremely willing to help us resolve them, and we were also willing to help our customers.
